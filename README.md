# The Holborn Feast [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JordanHatch/holborn-feast.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JordanHatch/holborn-feast)

A local directory of eateries in and around the Holborn area of London. Right now, it's being built as an internal tool for people at the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-teams/government-digital-service).

It's a re-imagining of a similar project built by [Richard Pope](https://twitter.com/richardjpope) just after the GOV.UK Beta team moved into Holborn.

In the future, I'd like to extract parts of this for others to use.
